## Am I really making a blog? No

This blog has a **threefold purpose** of which only one is related to the usual _"see my blog narcissism"_. Thus it is not a blog, but merely my thinking about why the answer is 42<sup>1</sup>. The threefold purpose is as follows: 
- **First** and foremost, it is a place for me to **deload thoughts** that I would like to recall at some other point in time. Publishing it online allows me to do just that, because I can access what I have written from anywhere as long as there is internet available.
- **Second**, others can **see what I think** about different topics. How helpful is really quite unknowable at this point in time, but that really doesn't matter because we are in bonus territory due to purpose 1.
- **Third**, I want to **document my thinking** about current affairs. This can be helpful
